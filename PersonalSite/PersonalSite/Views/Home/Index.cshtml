                    Hello everyone, my name is Quintin Dublin. I am a 7 year U.S. Army vetern. My army career began after I graduated highschool. In the Army I spent my time as a Communication Specialist, where I workied on various technology equipment. Once my tour ended I began working as an assistant manager for Uhaul. Shortly after, I became a Security guard, I learned about Centriq and the courses that were offered.  I became a student in 2019 and gained my A+, Networking and Security Certification. Shortly after, I began working at Saint Lukes Health System, as a desktop technician while I continued training to become a Full Stack Developer. My course has ended as of June 2020 and I am now a graduate of this course as well.</P>
